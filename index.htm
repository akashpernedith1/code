<h2 class="Pawn"><i class="fas fa-chess-pawn fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>The pawn (♙,♟) is the most numerous piece in the game of chess, and in most circumstances, also the weakest. It historically represents infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.[1] Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="Bishop"><i class="fas fa-chess-bishop fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement. Bishops, like all other pieces except the knight, cannot jump over other pieces. A bishop captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.
The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin on, i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a consequence of its diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or black squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as light-squared or dark-squared bishops.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="Knight"><i class="fas fa-chess-knight fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>Another word for this piece is "Horse". Compared to other chess pieces, the knight's movement is unique: it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). While moving, the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination.[4][5][6] Knights capture in the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from the board. Knights and pawns are the only pieces that can be moved in the initial position.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="Rook"><i class="fas fa-chess-rook fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>The white rooks start on squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start on a8 and h8. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares (see diagram). As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits. The rook also participates, with the king, in a special move called castling.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="Queen"><i class="fas fa-chess-queen fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>The white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8. With the chessboard oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen starts on a black square—thus the mnemonics "queen gets her color", "queen on [her] [own] color", or "the dress [queen piece] matches the shoes [square]" (Latin: servat rēgīna colōrem).
The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="King"><i class="fas fa-chess-king fa-5x"></i></h2>
<p>White starts with the king on e1, on the first rank to the right of the queen. Black starts with the king on e8, directly across from the white king. The kings always start on a square of opposite color.
A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece, or the move would place the king in check. As a result, opposing kings may never occupy adjacent squares (see opposition) to give check, as that would put the moving king in check as well. However, the king can give discovered check by unblocking a bishop, rook, or queen. The king is also involved in the special move of castling.</p>
